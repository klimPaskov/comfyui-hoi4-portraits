# Chaos Redux Subagents

Use this skill when a Chaos Redux task should be split across project custom Codex subagents.

The parent Codex agent remains responsible for final integration, validation, and completion claims. Subagents can inspect, patch, create assets, write addenda, or produce reports. The parent must review their outputs, wire final cross-surface behavior, and carry blockers into the final report.

Do not use subagents to hide uncertainty or pass off responsibility. A subagent handoff is evidence for the parent, not a replacement for parent review.

## Fork context rule

All project custom Codex subagents must be spawned with `fork_context=false`.

Do not spawn any project subagent with inherited parent-thread context. The parent prompt must include every path, user correction, task constraint, scope boundary, previous handoff status, accepted plan, queued plan, and design rule the subagent needs.

If the needed context only exists in conversation, summarize it into the subagent prompt or write it to the relevant spec, plan, handoff, or repo file before spawning. Then spawn the subagent with `fork_context=false`.

This rule applies to every subagent type:

- read-only agents
- plan-only agents
- asset-production agents
- super-event research agents
- active small-patch agents
- scripted-system agents
- documentation agents
- skill-maintenance agents

The goal is to keep subagents narrow, reproducible, and grounded in explicit inputs instead of inherited conversation state.


## Available project subagents

Use `chaosx_repo_explorer` only for read-only repo exploration when touched-file mapping, pattern search, vanilla reference mapping, missing-file recovery, dependency mapping, or edit-order planning is actually unclear. It is not a default preflight agent.

Use `chaosx_improvement_loop_planner` for event improvement loop planning, detailed expansion specs, historical and regional research notes, and implementation-ready improvement handoffs. This replaces the old mechanic-expander role. It writes plans and addenda. It does not patch gameplay files.

Use `chaosx_asset_source_researcher` for real or archival image sourcing, immutable real-person portrait sources, exact crop and crop-equality evidence, historical flags, historical symbols, user-provided source photos, source-image processing, animated portrait bases, and report, news, or super-event images that must depict real historical material. For a real-person portrait it stops at the source-and-crop handoff.

Use `chaosx_hoi4_portrait_pipeline` for bounded Krea 2 production of a real-person leader, commander, operative, or named-officeholder portrait after the attributed source and exact crop exist. It produces candidates and evidence, then final PNG/DDS only after an independent audit PASS. It does not source identities, approve itself, or wire gameplay.

Use `chaosx_portrait_identity_auditor` for independent read-only candidate review. It returns schema-valid likeness, style, mask, and provenance PASS, FAIL, or UNCERTAIN verdicts. It cannot generate, edit, rank, select, or convert candidates.

Use `chaosx_generated_event_art` for generated non-icon art, including fictional or alternate-history report images, news images, super-event images, fictional portraits, fictional flags, faction emblems, UI panels, dossier art, progression-state base art, and animated non-icon presentation pieces.

Use `chaosx_icon_artist` for focus icons, idea icons, national spirit icons, officer corps icons, decision icons, decision category icons, achievement icons, tech icons, formable seals, scripted GUI icons, and small animated icon or button sprites.

Use `chaosx_3d_model_pipeline` for bounded custom HOI4 3D model work covering geometry, provider candidates, Blender processing, model textures, rigs, skeletal actions, `.mesh`/`.anim` export, QA evidence, and runtime handoffs.

Use `chaosx_super_event_text_researcher` for super-event main quotes, exact wording checks, attribution confidence, source comparison, button text, cultural remarks, slogans, allusions, and short references.

Use `chaosx_super_event_audio_researcher` for licensed or public domain audio research, source verification, download, `.ogg` conversion, and audio handoff notes.

Use `chaosx_focus_tree_auditor` for focus tree audits and active small patches covering branch depth, route coverage, icons, localisation, rewards, prerequisites, mutual exclusions, AI, focus-formable links, and simplification.

Use `chaosx_decision_mission_auditor` for decision and mission audits and active small patches covering category lifecycle, objective quality, costs, tooltips, scripted GUI decision hooks, AI behavior, cleanup, balance, and exploit risk.

Use `chaosx_country_package_auditor` for country package audits and active small patches covering tags, custom-tag history, generated startup scientists, existing-country startup grants, states, leaders, portraits, flags, parties, focus loading, ideas, advisors, units, technologies, claims, cores, localisation, AI, formables, and playable setup.

Use `chaosx_localisation_auditor` for localisation and scripted localisation audits and active small patches covering missing keys, duplicate keys, encoding, tooltip quality, broken dynamic text, namespace consistency, dynamic cost text, and cross-surface text mismatch.

Use `chaosx_scripted_system_architect` for reusable scripted system design and active narrow implementation covering scripted effects, scripted triggers, script constants, event targets, meta effects, variables, tuning values, formable helpers, scripted GUI button helpers, and dynamic helper logic.

Use `chaosx_documentation_curator` for documentation cleanup and consistency during long implementation. It reconciles specs, plans, docs, handoffs, manifests, prompts, reports, and README files, writes source-of-truth maps and resume packets, marks superseded docs, records plan dispositions, and flags contradictions. It patches documentation surfaces only and does not edit gameplay files, localisation, assets, or spreadsheets.

Use `chaosx_event_completion_auditor` for read-only spec-versus-implementation audits covering events, mechanics, assets, docs, super-events, focus trees, decisions, validation, and accepted plan addenda.

Use `chaosx_spreadsheet_doc_worker` only for the event catalog workbook at `docs/spreadsheets/chaos_redux_events_catalog.xlsx`. It uses the xlsx/spreadsheet skill, keeps the workbook player-facing, and matches event log, event detail, evolution detail, and cluster detail fields to the in-game wording.

Do not route new work to `chaosx_mechanic_expander`. Its role is merged into `chaosx_improvement_loop_planner` and the `chaos-redux-improvement-loop` skill.

## Repo explorer use gate

`chaosx_repo_explorer` is an optional scout for uncertain or broad work. It should save time by finding files, patterns, precedents, and edit order before the parent starts a complex implementation.

Use `chaosx_repo_explorer` when at least one of these is true:

- the parent does not know the likely touched files
- the task spans several systems and the edit order is uncertain
- the correct Chaos Redux pattern or vanilla precedent is unclear
- a named spec, prompt, source file, classification, sprite, tag, localisation key, or helper appears missing and needs recovery evidence
- the feature has enough cross-surface risk that a file map and meaningful validation plan will prevent missed work

Do not spawn `chaosx_repo_explorer` for small or already bounded work, including:

- known-file edits
- user-provided file updates
- direct skill, prompt, or TOML updates
- small bug fixes where the relevant files are already named
- localisation-only cleanup with known keys
- asset-only production that belongs to an asset subagent
- spreadsheet-only catalog updates that belong to `chaosx_spreadsheet_doc_worker`
- simple report, docs, or markdown edits where the parent can inspect the provided files directly

When the task is small, the parent should read the known files directly and proceed. Do not use repo exploration as a ritual step or as a replacement for parent review.

## Authority model

Subagents should act at the level their role requires. Do not make every subagent read-only by default.

### Read-only agents

These agents do not patch gameplay files:

- `chaosx_repo_explorer`
- `chaosx_event_completion_auditor`

They may write reports only when a report path is provided or obvious from the task.

### Plan-only agents

`chaosx_improvement_loop_planner` writes event expansion specs, improvement addenda, deep research notes, historical connection notes, and implementation handoffs. It does not edit gameplay, localisation, GUI, scripted effects, focus trees, decisions, assets, spreadsheets, or country files.

When an event mechanic needs more depth, new branches, new countries, a new formable suite, a new scripted GUI system, deeper regional logic, historical anchors, or a larger route redesign, the planner writes a plan under `docs/plans/<event_id>_<event_slug>_plans/`. The main agent decides what to implement.

The parent should use this planner after a meaningful implementation tranche, not after every small patch. Do not spawn it again for the same event until its previous addendum has been implemented, folded into specs, queued with a reason, or rejected with a reason.

### Documentation curation agents

`chaosx_documentation_curator` is patch-capable for documentation surfaces only. It may update Markdown specs, docs, plans, handoffs, manifests, prompt files, README files, route coverage tables, source-of-truth ledgers, resume packets, and documentation indexes inside the current task scope.

Use it after long implementation tranches, after several subagent handoffs, before a major resume, or whenever docs may be stale, contradictory, duplicated, or too numerous. It should reduce confusion for the parent agent by recording what is current, what is superseded, what is queued, what is rejected, and what still needs a decision.

It must not edit gameplay files, localisation, scripted localisation, GUI, GFX, events, focuses, decisions, ideas, scripted effects, scripted triggers, on_actions, country setup, history, AI files, assets, audio, binary files, or the event catalog workbook. It does not replace `chaosx_event_completion_auditor`, `chaosx_localisation_auditor`, `chaosx_spreadsheet_doc_worker`, or `chaosx_repo_explorer`.

### Asset-production agents

Asset subagents create source files, processed previews, final DDS outputs, contact sheets, manifests, and asset handoffs. During active work, event-scoped evidence belongs under the temporary `docs/assets/<event_id>_<event_slug>/` workspace. They do not wire gameplay, localisation, GFX, GUI, events, focuses, decisions, or spreadsheets unless the parent gives a narrow exception.

### Real-person portrait production agents

Real-person portraits use a three-owner chain:

1. `chaosx_asset_source_researcher` finds and verifies the real photograph, records provenance and rights, performs the subject-ownership search, and creates the exact source crop and equality evidence.
2. `chaosx_hoi4_portrait_pipeline` runs the standalone ComfyUI production job and creates candidates, masks, comparisons, manifests, and final PNG/DDS only after a separate PASS.
3. `chaosx_portrait_identity_auditor` reviews randomized candidates independently and returns schema-valid gate verdicts without selecting a winner.

All three must be spawned with `fork_context=false` and context-complete prompts. The producer and auditor must have different identities and process ids. The producer cannot see or create its own approval. The auditor cannot receive producer ranking. The parent chooses among independently eligible candidates and owns runtime wiring, live-consumer validation, and the completion claim.

Keep the ComfyUI MCP or API route inside `hoi4-portrait-pipeline` and the standalone portrait project. Do not create a central MCP skill. Use direct integration only after a topology preflight proves one session can access both machines. Otherwise use portable checksummed handoffs.

The parent owns temporary-workspace cleanup. Keep the event-scoped `docs/assets/` workspace while the event is active, blocked, awaiting review, or undergoing acceptance scenarios. Before declaring the event goal fully complete, promote durable provenance, licensing, attribution, coverage, review, and sprite-handoff facts into permanent event or plan documentation, verify that no runtime reference points into `docs/assets/`, then delete the complete event-scoped workspace. An absent workspace is expected for a fully complete event. Never delete a skill-local reference library or an unrelated event workspace.

### 3D model routing

Route `chaosx_3d_model_pipeline` only with `fork_context=false` and a context-complete prompt containing the exact deterministic job root, reference-image path or approved asset brief, output folders, handoff path, asset profile, named vanilla references, scale relationship, required action roles, credit and paid-attempt limits, dependency lock, and forbidden simplifications. The parent must pass the owner/asset identifiers explicitly; the subagent must not infer them from inherited conversation state.

The parent prompt must also require the MESHY_API_KEY hard gate before path discovery or provider work, exactly one Meshy input image when no ready image exists, no multi-view provider board, immediate provider download and checksum, protected provider source, topology repair, PDX packed-material validation, hash-aware runtime synchronization, and `.mesh`/`.anim` reimport evidence. For humanoids, name the installed vanilla source mesh and entity and pass the source-height/entity-scale/effective-runtime crosswalk; for buildings, pass the valid state/province pair and entity visibility test.

Its allowed scope is source/reference preservation, provider candidates, downloaded GLB/FBX and lineage, Blender source and checkpoints, bounded geometry/material/rig/weight/action work, processed model textures and DDS files, `.mesh`/`.anim` exports, previews, manifests, QA/reimport evidence, crosswalk rows, and handoffs. It must not edit gameplay, GFX, `.gfx`, `.gui`, `.asset`, entity, localisation, events, focuses, decisions, country/history/AI, on-actions, or spreadsheets.

The handoff must list files and checksums, provider task lineage and credits, verified dependency versions, Blender checkpoint stages, geometry/material/rig/weight/action/export results, reimport or parser evidence (or an explicit missing-capability blocker), proposed runtime identifiers, statuses, skipped meaningful validation, and remaining risks. Use only actual provider or Blender tool names discovered and verified by the parent; missing integrations are `required installation/verification` or `blocked`, not invented capabilities. Any viewer or inspector is read-only.

The parent alone owns `.asset`/entity/GFX/runtime source wiring, live-consumer and in-game validation, runtime evidence, and the overall completion claim. A successful provider task, `.blend`, preview, or export never authorizes the subagent to claim the feature is complete or to silently use a fallback.

### Active small-patch agents

These agents are patch-capable by default inside the current task scope:

- `chaosx_scripted_system_architect`
- `chaosx_decision_mission_auditor`
- `chaosx_focus_tree_auditor`
- `chaosx_country_package_auditor`
- `chaosx_localisation_auditor`

They do not need a separate permission prompt to fix small, local issues that are clearly connected to the current event, mechanic, country, focus tree, decision category, GUI surface, or localisation surface.

They should inspect first, then patch only when the fix is narrow, reversible, and supported by the relevant skill. They may edit files they own for the current task surface and directly related dependency files. They must not search for unrelated cleanup outside the feature they were spawned for.

Active small patches include:

- varying decision costs inside an existing category
- making cost and requirement text clearer
- adding dynamic localisation for existing variables, targets, state names, route names, or cost values
- replacing raw trigger exposure with custom trigger tooltips
- adjusting safe AI weights or target checks
- fixing obvious availability, visibility, cooldown, bypass, and cleanup gaps
- fixing focus prerequisites, route locks, mutual exclusions, focus filters, icon references, and small reward variety
- adding a narrow scripted helper plus a few direct call sites when repeated logic is already present
- fixing an existing formable decision check, reveal condition, or state-control requirement
- correcting country package references such as focus loading, party names, leader ids, tag setup, localisation, and simple starting setup

Active small patches do not include:

- creating or expanding a whole mechanic
- adding a full event chain
- replacing a focus route family
- designing a new formable suite
- building a new scripted GUI system
- creating a new country package from scratch
- changing broad balance philosophy
- rewriting large localisation sets for tone only
- changing asset source rules
- claiming final completion of the parent feature

When a patch-capable subagent sees a broad design gap, it writes a plan handoff and stops. The main agent decides whether to implement it.

## Mandatory handoff after any patch

Every subagent that edits files must write a handoff back to the parent. If the event id and slug are known, place it under:

```text
docs/plans/<event_id>_<event_slug>_plans/subagent_handoffs/
```

The handoff should include:

- files changed
- exact gameplay surface changed
- changed ids, keys, tags, helper names, or state groups
- before and after behavior
- why the change is safe and bounded
- meaningful validation run, limited to task-specific checks that affect confidence
- skipped meaningful validation and why
- remaining issues or design gaps
- any follow-up the parent must implement

Do not fill handoffs with passing boilerplate checks that only restate AGENTS.md rules. Basic syntax hygiene can be done internally unless it found a problem or materially changed the patch.

If a patch touches localisation, list the keys changed. If it touches decisions or focuses, list affected ids. If it touches scripted helpers, list helper names and call sites. If it touches country setup, list tags and state ids or state groups.

## MCP evidence in handoffs

When a routed task touches focus trees, event chains, technology or doctrine trees, weighted logic, scripted GUI, or maps, use MCP as the shared evidence surface. Pass only the diagnostics, revision, scenario hash, comparison, or linked artifact URI the parent needs instead of copying a complete graph or matrix into the prompt.

For probability work, name the analyzed surface and scenario ids, state whether the candidate pool and external factors were complete, and distinguish exact, bounded, sampled, score-only, and unresolved results. For technology or doctrine work, list the affected technology, folder, unlock, grant, bonus, or asset ids and include the relevant `hoi4.tech_compare` result when source changed.

## Plan and spec paths

Full accepted event specs belong under:

```text
docs/specs/<event_id>_<event_slug>_specs/
```

Subagent plans, expansion addenda, audit follow-up notes, blocked reports, implementation handoffs, and patch handoffs belong under:

```text
docs/plans/<event_id>_<event_slug>_plans/
```

The plans folder is the working area. The specs folder is the source-of-truth design area. If a plan is accepted as source design, the main agent should fold it into the relevant spec file or clearly report that it remains queued.

Do not create new planning folder names such as `docs/planning/` unless the user explicitly asks.

## Asset routing

Do not use one broad asset worker for mixed visual packages.

Use:

- `chaosx_asset_source_researcher` for real, archival, historical, documentary, or public-source images when the asset must show real historical material
- `chaosx_generated_event_art` for generated non-icon fictional, alternate-history, symbolic, high-chaos, or unique event art
- `chaosx_icon_artist` for generated gameplay icons, formable seals, decision category icons, and small animated icon or button sprites

The parent agent must give each asset subagent a bounded prompt with exact asset names, target sizes, source mode, final folders, sprite names when already registered, reference folders, and constraints.

Country-identity asset work must not start until the parent has audited the candidate tag against vanilla, Chaos Redux, every installed Workshop mod, and other local mods, and has checked whether the national identity already exists in vanilla. A conflicting new tag must be remapped; a vanilla country identity must reuse the vanilla tag and preserve its meaningful content. Pass the locked tag and audit evidence into the context-free subagent prompt.

Portrait prompts must inspect the canonical reference root `C:/Users/klimp/OneDrive/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/chaos_redux/.agents/skills/chaos-redux-event-assets/assets/vanilla_reference`, the matching leader, commander, or operative contact sheet, and the male quick-reference routing at `C:/Users/klimp/OneDrive/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/chaos_redux/.agents/skills/chaos-redux-event-assets/assets/leader_portraits/README.md`. Real people require an attributed source, explicit head-and-shoulders crop, crop equality evidence, source/crop metadata, and a source handoff from `chaosx_asset_source_researcher`. Production then goes to `chaosx_hoi4_portrait_pipeline`, and likeness approval goes to the separate `chaosx_portrait_identity_auditor`. A polity that existed in whole or in part, represents a real community, or claims continuity from a real institution is grounded and must use sourced real people or authentic institutional material rather than an invented substitute. Fictional one-person portraits require ImageGen only when both the leader and polity are wholly fictional and deliberately high-chaos. They must look extraordinary and culturally coherent within the invented setting, not like normal interchangeable officers. Fictional councils, committees, juntas, boards, offices, and symbolic bodies require people-free institutional ImageGen compositions and institutional names; do not generate a crowd or invented officeholder.



For `chaosx_icon_artist`, the parent prompt must require `$imagegen` source atlas or source PNG evidence, prompt and source-mode notes, transparent-background processing, contact sheets, dimension and alignment QA, no white matte or opaque square backgrounds, and confirmation that final generated icons are not primitive local drawings or resized unrelated icons.

For flags, the parent prompt must state whether each flag is a base flag, ideology variant, route variant, cosmetic-tag flag, historical flag, or fictional flag. Every final flag requires imagegen source evidence. Historical flags and attested symbols begin with `chaosx_asset_source_researcher`, then use the cited design as a strict imagegen input; fictional or alternate-history variants belong with `chaosx_generated_event_art`. Require clean flat flag designs, exact historical geometry and symbols when attested, and reject waving fabric, folds, flagpoles, scenery, painterly artwork, perspective, lighting, gradients, fake text, or invented heraldry. Base flags for existing countries must be preserved unless explicitly in scope. Ideology variants must be distinct designs, not recolors or copied emblems.

Asset subagents may create source files, PNG previews, DDS files, contact sheets, manifests, and `gfx_handoff.md`. They must not edit `.gfx`, localisation, GUI, event, focus, idea, decision, script, history, country, or spreadsheet files unless the parent explicitly expands scope.

## Super-event routing

Use separate research agents when the super-event package has enough work to justify it.

Use `chaosx_super_event_text_researcher` for quotes, exact wording, attribution confidence, button text, cultural remarks, slogans, allusions, and short references.

Use `chaosx_super_event_audio_researcher` for audio research, license verification, download, `.ogg` conversion, and audio handoff notes.

Use `chaosx_asset_source_researcher` or `chaosx_generated_event_art` for image work according to the source mode required by `chaos-redux-event-assets`.

The main agent owns final wiring, localisation, settings-aware playback, docs, and spreadsheet alignment.

## Improvement routing

Use `chaosx_improvement_loop_planner` when an event or event-adjacent mechanic needs new design material, not just an audit finding.

The planner should read `chaos-redux-improvement-loop`, `chaos-redux-event-planning`, and relevant system skills. It should inspect actual implementation, specs, plans, docs, localisation, and asset notes when available. It should then write concrete design material that expands the event through playable mechanics, historical or regional connections, AI behavior, and visual needs. It should not patch gameplay files.

The main agent should deploy the planner often enough to keep major events from becoming shallow after new mechanics are added, but not so often that plans pile up. For the same event, do not deploy another planner pass until the previous addendum is implemented, promoted to specs, queued with a reason, or rejected.

Audit subagents may include compact improvement handoffs inside their reports. If a gap requires a new route family, new GUI system, new formable suite, new country package, or new event chain, they should recommend a plan-mode pass rather than trying to patch it.

## Spreadsheet catalog routing

`chaosx_spreadsheet_doc_worker` is a context-light spreadsheet worker, not a general documentation agent.

Use it when the only required output is an update to:

```text
docs/spreadsheets/chaos_redux_events_catalog.xlsx
```

The workbook is the only editable catalog source. The three catalog CSVs are export-only snapshots generated from the workbook's `Events`, `Clusters`, and `Scenarios` sheets. After the worker saves the workbook, it must run:

```text
python .tools/export_event_catalog_csv.py
```

The worker must never edit the CSVs directly or treat a stale CSV as the source of truth. If the exporter fails, report the failure and leave the workbook as the only attempted edit until the exporter can be rerun.

The parent prompt should provide event ids, row targets, source localisation keys, or the exact fields to update when possible.

The worker should read only:

- the parent prompt
- the xlsx/spreadsheet skill
- the event catalog workbook
- the localisation or scripted localisation needed to mirror player-facing event log, event detail, evolution detail, or cluster wording
- named source files explicitly provided by the parent

It should not read HOI4 wiki pages, vanilla documentation, vanilla files, broad implementation guides, or unrelated repo systems. It should not edit docs, specs, plans, manifests, gameplay files, localisation files, assets, GFX, GUI, events, focuses, decisions, ideas, history, scripted effects, scripted triggers, or other spreadsheets unless the parent explicitly expands scope.

The worker must preserve workbook structure, formatting, formulas, filters, and validation unless the parent explicitly asks for structural changes.

## Parent review

The parent agent must review every subagent output before relying on it.

Before final completion, the parent should check:

- subagent changes are inside approved scope
- patch handoffs identify changed files and ids
- plan handoffs are either implemented, queued, or rejected with a reason
- documentation curator handoffs identify promoted, queued, rejected, superseded, and unresolved documents when one was used
- assets are wired or reported as pending
- temporary event asset workspaces are retained for active or blocked work and deleted only after durable evidence and runtime wiring have been reconciled
- advisor candidates have separate manifest-linked native-plus-`4x` visual approval from a reviewer who is not the producer; automated validation alone is not approval
- validation reflects the final repo state
- docs, specs, plans, and spreadsheet surfaces agree

A subagent patch can reduce workload. It never owns the final completion claim.
